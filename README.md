## CS 4690 - Angularified Project

The following repository contains code that whose purpose is to display student information using a list of student data stored in JSON files. The code is written using a couple of pieces of the mean stack, although not fully implementing the entire stack. It's a work in progress and will get there eventually.

The code was originally written using a hefty amount of jquery and bootstrap, but is currently being altered to use mainly Angular (v1), and implementing the design principles for Material Design.

## But why?

Although the following page has very little practical use in the real world, it is a proof of concept that has allowed me and my fellow class members practice design and programming principles in a real world setting.

## Installation

Step 1: Have node (version 6 or higher) and npm installed.

Step 2: Download the code in this project in it's entirety.

Step 3a: Look under server >> nodeserver.js and see all of the npm packages being downloaded

Step 3b: Use npm to install all of the neccessary modules.

Step 4: type "node nodeserver.js" from within the server folder on a command prompt.

All done! The server will display to the console that it is listening. Head to your browser and type "localhost:3000" in the URL.
